    "## Understanding Evaluation in GenAIOps\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is the foundation of trust in AI applications, making it a critical part of the Generative AI Ops (GenAIOps) lifecycle. Without rigorous evaluation at each step, the AI solution can produce content that is fabricated (ungrounded in reality), irrelevant, harmful - or vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three stages of GenAIOps Evaluation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Model Selection** - Before building your application, select the right base model for your use case. Use evaluators to compare base models using criteria like accuracy, quality, safety and task performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-Production Evaluation** - Once you have selected a base model, customize it to build your AI application (e.g., RAG with data, agentic AI). This pre-production phase is where you iterate rapidly on the prototype, using evaluations to assess robustness, validate edge cases, measure key metrics, and simulate real-world interactions for testing coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Post-Production Monitoring** - Ensures the AI application maintains desired quality, safety and performance goals in real-world environments with capabilities that include performance tracking and fast incident response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **evaluators** become critical. Evaluators are specialized tools that help you assess the quality, safety and reliability of your AI application responses. The Azure AI Foundry platform offers a comprehensive suite of built-in evaluators covering use cases including: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic AI, safety & security, textual similarity, and general purpose evaluators."
