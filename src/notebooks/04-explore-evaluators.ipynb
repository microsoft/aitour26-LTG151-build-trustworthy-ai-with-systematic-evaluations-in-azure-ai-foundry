    "## Understanding Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are powerful productivity assistants that can create complex workflows for business needs. Unlike simple query-response AI systems, agents involve multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intent Recognition** - Understanding what the user wants to accomplish\n",
    "- **Tool Selection & Usage** - Choosing and correctly using available tools\n",
    "- **Task Execution** - Following through on the assigned workflow\n",
    "- **Response Generation** - Providing helpful and accurate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user queries \"What's the weather tomorrow?\", an agentic workflow might involve reasoning through user intents, calling weather APIs, and utilizing retrieval-augmented generation. It's crucial to evaluate each step of the workflow, plus the quality and safety of the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry provides specialized **agent evaluators** that assess these unique aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent Resolution** - Measures whether the agent correctly identifies the user's intent\n",
    "2. **Tool Call Accuracy** - Measures whether the agent made the correct function tool calls\n",
    "3. **Task Adherence** - Measures whether the agent's response adheres to its assigned tasks"

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully learned how to evaluate AI agents using Azure AI Foundry's specialized evaluators! \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Accomplished\n",
    "- Used **IntentResolutionEvaluator** to measure intent understanding\n",
    "- Assessed **ToolCallAccuracyEvaluator** for correct tool selection\n",
    "- Applied **TaskAdherenceEvaluator** to ensure agents stay within scope\n",
    "- Evaluated complex multi-step agent conversations\n",
    "- Created batch evaluation workflows for multiple scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Agent evaluators provide specialized metrics for agentic workflows beyond simple query-response\n",
    "- Binary pass/fail results with detailed reasoning help identify specific improvement areas\n",

    "1. **Continuous Evaluation** - Set up automated evaluation pipelines for agent deployments\n",
    "2. **Threshold Monitoring** - Configure alerts when scores drop below acceptable levels\n",
    "3. **A/B Testing** - Compare different agent configurations using evaluation metrics\n",
    "4. **User Feedback Integration** - Combine automated evaluations with human feedback\n",
    "5. **Tool Coverage Testing** - Ensure all available tools are properly tested\n",
