## üéôÔ∏è | Speaker Prep

This session is titled "Build Trustworthy AI with Systematic Evaluations in Azure AI Foundry". It is **only 15 minutes long** which should be just about enough to do 2 demos and some explainer slides.

**Takeaways**: The goal is to leave audience with 3 takeaways:

1. Observability is the foundation for trustworthy AI 
1. Evaluations & Red Teaming help assess reliability

Here is a high-level view of the "run of show" for this session. Every speaker differs in their delivery style and pacing - if you find yourself time-constrained, prioritize demos and deprioritize slides.

| Slides | Duration | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 3 | 1 min | Introduce Yourself ¬∑ Introduce topic |
| 4-7 | 2 min | Introduce Observability ¬∑ Describe Flow |
| 8-10 | 4 min | Introduce Safety & Quality Evals ¬∑ Demo  |
| 11-13 | 4 min | Introduce New Evaluators ¬∑ Demo |
| 14 | 1 min | Introduce Red Teaming |
| 15-21 | 3 min | "Azure AI Foundry Does More!" ¬∑ CTA |
| | | |

If you are time-constrained, you can reduce this to 3 minutes of talk and use the remaining time for demos. The final slide will give audience link to these slides for review later.

1. (Slide 5) Introduce Observability - _1 min_
2. (Slides 8-10) Quality & Safety Evals - _DEMO_
3. (Slides 11-13) New Evaluators - _DEMO_
4. (Slide 15) Azure AI Foundry is "Observability first" - _1 min_
5. (Slide 21) Check out resources to learn more - _1 min_


## üöÄ | Demo Prep

The theater session has 2 main demo segments. This repository is setup with notebooks that will help you walk through the demos. 

_We recommend you provision the infrastructure and run the notebooks ahead of the session._ Then adopt the "cooking demo" approach where we start the process and show end results:

1. Run notebooks before session - check portal has results
1. Show notebooks in session - run them again live
1. Walk through some key snippets - e.g., evaluator, API
1. Switch to portal to show finished results - from step 1

Encourage attendees to come talk to you after for Q&A - this gives you and them a chance to explore the code or live demo interactively with less time co

**Demo Setup**: This repository is provisioned with a devcontainer - just launch it with GitHub Codespaces (cloud) or Docker Desktop (local) to get a prebuilt development environment. 

Then follow these steps to complete demo setup and validate them before session
